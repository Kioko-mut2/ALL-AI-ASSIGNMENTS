Step-by-Step Explanation of the Notebook
1. Problem Definition

Code Link: Comments at the top of the notebook.

Explanation:

The problem is predicting whether a patient will be readmitted within 30 days.

Target variable: readmitted_30days.

Key stakeholders: hospital staff, patients.

KPI: Precision and recall of the predictions.

2. Data Collection & Preprocessing

Code Link: # 1. Simulate Hypothetical Patient Dataset & # 2. Preprocessing

Explanation:

We created a simulated dataset with 200 patients to mimic real EHR data.

Features include demographics (age, gender), clinical info (num_previous_admissions, comorbidity_score, length_of_stay), and discharge type.

Preprocessing handled:

Numerical scaling using StandardScaler.

Categorical encoding using OneHotEncoder.

Separation of features (X) and labels (y).

3. Model Development

Code Link: # 3. Train/Test Split & # 4. Model Training

Explanation:

Split data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets to evaluate generalization.

Random Forest chosen for:

Handling mixed data types.

Robustness to overfitting.

Interpretability via feature importance.

Hyperparameters tuned:

n_estimators (number of trees).

max_depth (controls overfitting).

4. Model Evaluation

Code Link: # 5. Evaluation

Explanation:

Metrics: Confusion matrix, precision, and recall.

Precision: % of predicted readmissions that were correct.

Recall: % of actual readmissions correctly identified.

Helps measure model effectiveness and ensures high-risk patients are flagged appropriately.

5. Deployment Simulation

Code Link: # 6. Deployment Simulation

Explanation:

Saves the trained model and preprocessor (joblib) to simulate deployment.

Demonstrates how a new patient’s data can be processed and predicted.

Links to real-world deployment where the hospital system could query the model for real-time predictions.
